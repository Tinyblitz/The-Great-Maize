# The-Great-Maize

A class project for the class CS '6457 - Video Game Design' at Georgia Tech.

This repository includes the whole project (code and assets).

This was a team project.  I contributed specifically to content associated with enemy characters and the Boss character.  
I was 

- I solely created the scripts for the mushroom enemy, the ice cream enemy, and the Bosss as well as the respective animators.
- I created the model and animations for the Ice Cream enemy.
- I manually rigged and created the animations for the Boss from scratch using Blender.
- Assets and models for the enemies and Boss not mentioned above were pulled from open sources.  I do not claim ownership of them.
- I helped organize the layout for each scene
- I solely made the opening cutscene and the boss cutscene.
